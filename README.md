# A tutorial to learn Next Js 13

I have been wanting to learn react for quite a while.
However, I have been lazy and lacked the will to study it.
Now trying to begin my journey on react, I stumble upon a new framework that seems to be "Trendy" compared to React.
In this repo I try to learn Next-js, tailwind and probably react.
